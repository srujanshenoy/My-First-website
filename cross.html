    <!-- How to solve the cross in a rubik's cube. -->
    <p>
        The cross is the first stage of solving a Rubik's cube. It involves creating a white cross on the bottom face of the cube.
        To solve the cross, you need to identify the white edge pieces and move them to the bottom face. Once the white edge pieces are in place,
        you can use a series of algorithms to complete the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some tips for solving the cross:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for white edge pieces that are already on the bottom face.</li>
        <li>If a white edge piece is not on the bottom face, try to move it there using a series of basic moves.</li>
        <li>Once you have all of the white edge pieces on the bottom face, use an algorithm to complete the cross.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here is an example of an algorithm that can be used to complete the cross:
    </p>
    <pre>
    R U R' U' R U2 R'
    </pre>
    <p>
        This algorithm will rotate the white edge pieces on the bottom face so that they form a cross.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have completed the cross, you can move on to the next stage of solving the Rubik's cube, which is called the first two layers (F2L).
